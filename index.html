                    <p>UofSC students struggle to quickly determine whether required books are freely and legally
                        accessible because availability is scattered across campus library systems and publicâ€‘domain
                        repositories.

                    <p>
                        This affinity diagram organizes potential solution (book finder webpage similar to pages for
                        flights such as TripAdvisor but for books) into categories such as source choices, community,
                        UX, etc. It helps clarify the scope and potential obstacles for potential solution. Sketches were
                        initially created with Chat-GPT for template, but later edited by myself to ensure consistency and layout

                        Basic sketches outlining specific components of a Book Finder webpage including a mock homepage,
                        mock search filters/sorting options, mock page displaying specific book details, and a mock page
                        displaying what results should look like after a user searches for a book
